## Study of the temporal architecture of neuronal activity in Alzheimer's Disease using dynamic functional connectivity techniques

### Description

This is the complete repository for my bachelor thesis, carried out in collaboration with the Biomedical Engineering Research Group from Universidad de Valladolid. The aim of the project was the investigation of neuronal alterations produced by dementia due to Alzheimer’s Disease through MEG and EEG signals. The final strategy on this study was to applied a predictive model able to differentia between the three groups under study; i.e, controls, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment and patients with Alzheimer's Disease. For this, we implemented a Naïve Bayes classifier. 

Some of the results of this research where published in the Spanish Biomedical Engineering Society Conference 2021. ISBN: 978-84-09-36054-3 pg:22-25 [^1]

This project was the continuation of a previous research [^2]

This is all the code used for my Bachelor Thesis: Study of the temporal architecture of neuronal activity in 
Alzheimer's Disease using dynamic functional connectivity techniques. 

**Previous Steps folder**: This folder contains the code used to understand the data provided and make representations. It also includes simple 
metrics that lead to the final metrics.


The remaining files are composed of the final implementation used for the analysis of the study and some files used to reduce
the computation cost of each metric.
