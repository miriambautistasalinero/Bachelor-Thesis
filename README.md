##Bachelor-Thesis

This is all the code used for my Bachelor Thesis: Study of the temporal architecture of neuronal activity in 
Alzheimer's Disasease using dynamic functional connectivity techniques. 

#Previous Steps folder

This folder contains the code used to understand the data provided and make representations. It also includes simple 
metrics that lead to the final metrics.


The remaining files are composed of the final metrics used for the analysis of the study and some files used to reduce
the computation cost of each metric.
